# Introduction.

[cms-bot](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot) started as a single script used to drive PR approval and grew to
be the core of the whole release engineering process for CMSSW.

This fork of cms-bot has been modified to work with the Fermilab Jenkins infrastructure.

# Setup

Please see the [wiki page](https://github.com/LArSoft/cms-bot/wiki/Setting-up-Pull-Requests-and-or-Push-CI-testing-for-your-organizations-repositories) for instructions on having your repos tested on the Fermilab Jenkins CI infrastructure.
